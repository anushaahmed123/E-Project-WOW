    <h1 class="text-center">TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    <p>
      Shah Jahan was the fifth ruler of the Mughal dynasty. During his third regnal year, his favorite wife, known as
      Mumtaz Mahal, died due to complications arising from the birth of their fourteenth child. Deeply saddened, the
      emperor started planning the construction of a suitable, permanent resting place for his beloved wife almost
      immediately. The result of his efforts and resources was the creation of what was called the Luminous Tomb in
      contemporary Mughal texts and is what the world knows today as the Taj Mahal. <br>
      In general terms, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial, under an open sky. But notable domed mausolea for Mughals
      (as well as for other Central Asian rulers) were built prior to Shah Jahan’s rule, so in this regard, the Taj is
      not unique. The Taj is, however, exceptional for its monumental scale, stunning gardens, lavish ornamentation, and
      its overt use of white marble. <br>
      Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in Agra, where he took the throne in 1628. First conquered by Muslim invaders in
      the eleventh century, the city had been transformed into a flourishing area of trade during Shah Jahan’s rule.
      Situated on the banks of the Yamuna River allowed for easy access to water, and Agra soon earned the reputation as
      a “riverfront garden city,” on account of its meticulously planned gardens, lush with flowering bushes and
      fruit-bearing trees in the sixteenth century. Entry to the Taj Mahal complex via the forecourt, which in the
      sixteenth century housed shops, and through a monumental gate of inlaid and highly decorated red sandstone made
      for a first impression of grand splendor and symmetry: aligned along a long water channel through this gate is the
      Taj—set majestically on a raised platform on the north end. The rectangular complex runs roughly 1860 feet on the
      north-south axis, and 1000 feet on the east-west axis. Qur’anic verses inscribed into the walls of the building
      and designs inlaid with semi-precious stones—coral, onyx, carnelian, amethyst, and lapis lazuli—add to the
      splendor of the Taj’s white exterior. The dominant theme of the carved imagery is floral, showing some
      recognizable, and other fanciful species of flowers—another link to the theme of paradise. <br>
      Some of the Taj Mahal’s architecture fuses aspects from other Islamic traditions, but other aspects reflect
      indigenous style elements. In particular, this is evident in the umbrella-shaped ornamental chhatris (dome shaped
      pavillions) atop the pavilions and minarets. <br>
    <h2>What Does the Taj Mahal Represents</h2>
    When Mumtaz Mahal died at age 38 in 1631, the emperor is reported to have refused to engage in court festivities,
    postponed two of his sons’ weddings, and allegedly made frequent visits to his wife’s temporary resting place (in
    Burhanpur) during the time it took for the building of the Taj to be completed. Stories like these have led to the
    Taj Mahal being referred to as an architectural “symbol of love” in popular literature. But there are other
    theories: one suggests that the Taj is not a funeral monument, and that Shah Jahan might have built a similar
    structure even if his wife had not died. Based on the metaphoric specificity of Qur’anic and other inscriptions and
    the emperor’s love of thrones, another theory maintains that the Taj Mahal is a symbolic representation of a Divine
    Throne—the seat of God—on the Day of Judgment. A third view holds that the monument was built to represent a replica
    of a house of paradise. In the “paradisiacal mansion” theory, the Taj was something of a vanity project, built to
    glorify Mughal rule and the emperor himself. <br>
    If his accession to the throne was smooth, Shah Jahan’s departure from it was not. The emperor died not as a ruler,
    but as a prisoner. Relegated to Agra Fort under house arrest for eight years prior to his death in 1666, Shah Jahan
    could enjoy only a distant view of the Taj Mahal. But the resplendent marble mausoleum he built “with posterity in
    mind” endures, more than 350 years after it was constructed, and is believed to be the most recognizable sight in
    the world today. Laid to rest beside his beloved wife in the Taj Mahal, the man once called Padshah—King of the
    World—enjoys enduring fame, too, for having commissioned the world’s most extravagant and memorable mausoleum. <br>
    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    The Taj Mahal is one of the world’s great tourist attractions, hosting millions of visitors per year. Though it was
    designated as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and is currently overseen by the Archaeological Survey of India,
    its heavy visitor traffic is just one of the many factors that threaten the integrity of the site. <br>
    One of the biggest risk factors for the Taj Mahal is air pollution, which discolors the exterior and, some experts
    think, causes acid rain that deteriorates the marble. Air pollution is caused by a multitude of factors including
    industry, vehicle emissions, and the burning of household waste. The government of India designated an area called
    the Taj Trapezium Zone (named for its trapezoidal shape), a 10,400 square kilometer swath (about 4,000 square miles)
    of Agra encompassing the Taj Mahal as well as the Agra Fort and the historic Mughal settlement of Fatehpur Sikri.
    Oil refineries and coal-burning industries have been ordered to regulate their emissions or switch to natural gas
    within this zone, and most have complied. <br>
    There has also been a ban on auto traffic near the Taj Mahal, air quality monitors have been installed, and the
    Archaeological Survey of India has proposed a tourist cap and increased fees to limit visitor impact. <br>
    Another potential risk for the Taj Mahal is the drying up of the Yamuna River, which flows along the rear of the
    complex. The river has been partially dammed upstream from the Taj Mahal in order to augment municipal water
    supplies, and some argue that the changes in the soil due to the lower water table may be threatening the structural
    integrity of the monument. Various activists and scholars have claimed to have found cracks in the marble platform,
    sinking of the structure, and tipping of the minarets,
    The Taj Mahal is rightly a top destination for millions of travelers. As global tourism grows and the economic
    pressures of industry continue to increase, the authorities who oversee the site must strive to implement legal and
    structural measures to ensure that this irreplaceable monument survives.
